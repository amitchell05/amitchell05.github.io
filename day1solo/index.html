        <p>Hold fast to dreams<br>
            For if dreams die<br>
            Life is a broken-winged bird<br>
            That cannot fly.<br>
            Hold fast to dreams<br>
            For when dreams go<br>
            Life is a barren field<br>
            Frozen with snow.</p>

    <p>My name is Angela Mitchell. Currently, I am a digital painting hobbyist who lives in Missouri. In 2013, I earned a Bachelor of Liberal Studies degree and Honors Certificate from the University of Missouri-Saint Louis. After working as an office clerk for less than two years, I decided I wanted to take time off from work to improve my health and make a career change. Being an artist has been my dream since childhood, but it may be better to remain a hobbyist.</p>

    <h2>Web Design and Development Goal</h2>
    
    <p>Pursuing a career as a web designer, UI/UX designer, or front-end web developer may provide me the opportunity to be creative, design, and use computers to build products that provide positive experiences for users. This blend could be the right balance for me. I would love to create websites or digital products to help support non-profit organizations.</p>

    <h2>Three Key Traits</h2>

    <p>The following things strongly describe who I am:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Artistic - I love painting and drawing portraits, landscapes, and characters. Growing up, I loved illustrating my own books and making fan art of my favorite video game characters (Yuna from Final Fantasy 10, Lara Croft from the Tomb Raider series, etc.).</li>
        <li>Detail-oriented - I care about producing high quality, accurate work. Every detail matters to me.</li>
        <li>Empathetic - I care about others and do whatever I can to help, whether it is tutoring, volunteer work, or moral support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Favorite Website</h2>
